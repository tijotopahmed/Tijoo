# Tijotop Ahmed Binjibon

**Data Analyst | Biomathematics Researcher**

I'm a mathematical modeler and data analyst who bridges the gap between theoretical mathematics and practical data science. My work focuses on extracting actionable insights from complex datasets using statistical rigor and modern data tools.

## 💼 What I Do

I specialize in transforming raw data into clear insights through:

- **Biomedical Data Analysis** — Working with clinical and laboratory datasets to identify patterns and support research decisions
- **Mathematical Modelling** — Building computational models to simulate biological systems and validate experimental findings
- **Reproducible Workflows** — Creating clean, documented analysis pipelines that others can understand and build upon

My approach combines scientific rigor with practical business sense, making complex data accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 🎯 My Approach

Every project in this portfolio demonstrates:

✓ **Clear Documentation** — Code comments and written summaries that explain the "why" behind decisions  
✓ **Transparent Methods** — Step-by-step data cleaning and transformation with rationale  
✓ **Effective Visualization** — Charts and graphs designed to communicate, not just display data  
✓ **Actionable Insights** — Plain-language conclusions that drive decisions
